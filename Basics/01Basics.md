Que. What is Python?
Ans Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
    Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, 
    and analyze data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, 
    and used to create various programmes. This versatility and its beginner-friendliness have made 
    it one of the most used programming languages today.

    It is used for:
    - Data analysis and machine learning.
    - Web development.
    - Automation or scripting.
    - Software testing and prototyping.
    - Everyday tasks.

Que. What can Python do?
Ans 
    - Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    - Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    - Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Que. why Python?
Ans 
    - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
    - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some 
      other programming languages.
    - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 
      This means that prototyping can be very quick.
    - Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Que. Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Ans - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language 
      with influence from mathematics.
    - Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages 
      which often use semicolons or parentheses.
    - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, 
      functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.



Que. Python Indentation? 
Ans Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
    the indentation in Python is very important.
    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    Note: 
       - Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
       - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
         otherwise Python will give you an error.
        
Que. variable created?
Ans variables are created when you assign a value to it.
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
