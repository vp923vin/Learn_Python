Que. What is Python?
Ans Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
    Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, 
    and analyze data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, 
    and used to create various programmes. This versatility and its beginner-friendliness have made 
    it one of the most used programming languages today.

    It is used for:
    - Data analysis and machine learning.
    - Web development.
    - Automation or scripting.
    - Software testing and prototyping.
    - Everyday tasks.

Que. What can Python do?
Ans 
    - Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    - Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    - Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Que. why Python?
Ans 
    - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
    - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some 
      other programming languages.
    - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 
      This means that prototyping can be very quick.
    - Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Que. Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Ans - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language 
      with influence from mathematics.
    - Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages 
      which often use semicolons or parentheses.
    - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, 
      functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.



Que. Python Indentation? 
Ans Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
    the indentation in Python is very important.
    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    Note: 
       - Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
       - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
         otherwise Python will give you an error.
        
Que. variable created?
Ans variables are created when you assign a value to it.
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.


#Comments

- Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them
- Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.
- A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent 
  Python from executing code.

#Multiline Comments

- Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
- To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
- Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
- Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
  you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.
- As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it,
  and you have made a multiline comment.



#Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data values.

#Creating Variables

- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change 
  type after they have been set.

#Facts
- type() get the data type of the variable.
- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes



#Global Variables

- Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
- Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
- If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, 
  and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, 
  global and with the original value.

- Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.
