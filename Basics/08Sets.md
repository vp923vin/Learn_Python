# SETS
-  Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
 - Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
